                <h2>Props</h3>
                    <li>Numbers: 1 2 4.5 5</li>
                <h3>defaultProps</h3>
                    <li>Often you want a prop to have a default value that is used if an alternative isn't supplied when rendering the component.</li>
                    <li>This is achieved using the defaultProps attribute.</li>
                    <li> In the Card component, if a text prop isn't provided then the component will fall back to using an empty string.</li>
                <h3>Validating props with prop-types</h3>
                    <li>If you need extra confirmation that you are passing the correct information to a component via its props then you can use the 
                            <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prop-types">prop-types library.</a></li>
                    <li>There are a wide range of different validators which cover all of the core JavaScript types; 
                        you can see a full list of these in the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prop-types#usage">prop-types documentation</a>.</li>

            <div>
                <h2>States</h2>
                <li>The state is an object that is stored as part of a component and can be updated by the component itself. </li>
                <li>only stateful components can contain state. Stateless components can only be manipulated by changing the props passed to them.</li>
                <li>Stateful components are more powerful, but stateless components are often more reusable and simpler to reason about.</li>
                <li>This is the fundamental trade-off between stateless and stateful components. Stateful components are more powerful, </li>
                <li>but stateless components are often more reusable and simpler to reason about.</li>
                <li>As a general rule, you should prefer stateless components and only create stateful components when you really need to. </li>
