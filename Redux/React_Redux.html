                <p>You have seen how you can manage an application's state by dispatching actions through a reducer. But how does that process fit in with your React components? 
                    There are two aspects to this problem. You need to be able to:</p>
                    <li>Display data from your state in your React components</li>
                    <li>Modify the state when your user interacts with your components</li>

                <p>These problems are both solved by the <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux">React Redux Library</a></p>
                    <li>React Redux contains utilities that help you link React components to the Redux store</li>
