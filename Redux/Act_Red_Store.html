            <div>
                <p>Redux uses 3 constructions to manage and manipulate applicant's state:.</p>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    <li>Reducer</li>
                    <li>Store</li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                <li>Everytime your application wants to change the state of the app, it should dispatch an action</li>
                <li>For example, taking the Trello application, adding a new card to a list would be a single action. </li>
                <li>These actions are then handled by a reducer, which actually makes the changes to the state.</li>
                <li>Actions are represented by simple objects that have a type property</li>
                <li> The type property's value is a string indicating the type of action being carried out.</li>
                <li>Any additional properties are known as the action's payload</li>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Reducers</h2>
                <li>Reducers are responsible for modifying the application state based on an action.</li>
                <p>A Reducer takes two Arguments</p>
                <li>1. The first is the current state</li>
                <li>2. and the second is an action</li>
